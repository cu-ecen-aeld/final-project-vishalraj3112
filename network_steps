Soft-blocking

The output to 'sudo rfkill list' shows that your network card is "soft-blocked".

This could happen when the wireless card has been signalled to switch-off via the kernel.

Try the following steps:

    run in a terminal:

    sudo rfkill unblock wifi; sudo rfkill unblock all

    rerun sudo rfkill list to confirm that the card has been unblocked.

    reboot

    rerun sudo rfkill list again to confirm unblocking as been retained.

    rerun sudo lshw -class network - you should now see that the kernel has recognised (or not) the wireless card.

If the wireless kernel module has been recognised (it should not say "unclaimed"), Network Manager should now be able to see wireless networks that are available in your vacinity.

First of all, I think you'll have better luck if your router is set to use WPA2-AES and not TKIP.

Second, I believe you are taking the long, complicated route when the short, easy route would work perfectly well. First, I suggest you back up your current wpa_supplicant.conf file:

sudo mv /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf  /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.bak

Next, I suggest you edit /etc/network/interfaces:

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
address 192.168.1.150
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1
wpa-essid MYESSID12345
wpa-psk MYPASSWORD$1234567

Of course, substitute your details here. Restart the interface:

sudo ifdown wlan0 && sudo ifup -v wlan0

Test:

ping -c3 www.ubuntu.com
