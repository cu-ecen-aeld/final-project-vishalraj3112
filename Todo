Todo:
1. Add wifi and ssh configuration files in rootfs and build.
2. Install QT creater and find out way to deploy Qt application on yocto using ssh and Qt creater.
3. See if wifi works with new image.
4. Just download Qt creator on Linux and manually put the files in yocto.
Problems:
1. Wifi not working with Qt image.
2. ssh not happening with ubuntu, working with putty.

Solution: Install qt files manually on image and connect through ethernet.
